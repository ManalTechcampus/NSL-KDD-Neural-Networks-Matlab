# NSL-KDD-Neural-Networks-Matlab

Short description:
This code was used in one of the early projects I was working on. We were interested in identifying the impact of certain parameters in neural networks on the accuracy of classification. The model used the NSL-KDD dataset and the implementation was done in Matlab.
